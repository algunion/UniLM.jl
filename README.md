# UniLM.jl

**! Highly experimental / WIP**

UniLM.jl: Currently a Julia interface for OpenAI's language models, with the goal to become a unified solution for accessing multiple language models. While at the moment only OpenAI's models are supported, our vision is to evolve UniLM.jl into a versatile tool that simplifies the integration of diverse language models.

### Usage

You can play with the package using the github installation method. However, this is in a highly experimental state and I'll not publish it yet to Julia package registry (not yet).

This package is not documented yet. The best (and only) way to get started is to take a look at the examples from `test` directory.

Installation:

```bash
pkg> add https://github.com/algunion/UniLM.jl
```
