**! Highly experimental / WIP**

UniLM.jl: Currently a Julia interface for OpenAI's language models (focus on `gpt-x` models), with the goal to become a unified solution for accessing multiple language models. While at the moment only OpenAI's models are supported, the vision is to evolve UniLM.jl into a versatile tool that simplifies the integration of diverse language models.

### Usage

You can play with the package using the github installation method. However, this is in a highly experimental state and I'll not publish it yet to Julia package registry.

This package is not documented yet. The best (and only) way to get started is to take a look at the examples from `test` directory.

Installation:

```bash
pkg> add https://github.com/algunion/UniLM.jl
```
